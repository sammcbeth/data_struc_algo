!Tree Traversal!
- how do we visit every node one time.
- breadth first search:
    - starting at left and working across the tree.
    - visiting all nodes within a certain level of a tree.
    - then moving downwards
    - 
- depth first search:
    - in order:
        
    - pre order:
        - vist node
        - traverse left
        - traverse right
        - same order for every node
    - post order:
        - travers the left
        - traverse the right
        - visit node
