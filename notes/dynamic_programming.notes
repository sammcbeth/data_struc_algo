!Dynamic Programming!
- a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems solving each of those subproblems just once and storing their solutions
- a solution where one needs to find the ebst decisions one after the other.
- only works with problems that have optimal structure and overalpping subproblems
- subproblems is the breaking up of one large problemm into multiple smaller numbers.
- a problem is said to have optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems
- memoization:
    - storing the results of expenisve fucntion calls and returning the cahed resultwhen the same inputs occur again
