!Graph Traversal!
- visiting/updating/checking each vertex in a Graph
- for any node in a grqph theres no gaurentee that there is one unique path
- finding most similar objects based on closeness of distance
- depth first traveling in one direction as far as possible before backtracking
- breadth first visiting all directly linked nodes first and branching outwards.
- recursively call smaller helper function to travel along all vertices connected to the original.
