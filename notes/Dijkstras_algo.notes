!Dijkstras algorithm!
- implement a weighted graph
- walk though the streps of algorithm
- Every time we look to visit a new node we pick the node with the smallest known distance tovisit first
- once weve moved to the node were going to visit we look at each of its neighbors
- for each neighboring node we calculate the distance by summing the total edges that lead to the node were checking from the starting node
- if the new total distance to a node is less that the previous total we store the new shorter distance for that node.
